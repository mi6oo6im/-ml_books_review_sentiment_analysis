شابک9789644185205؛داستانی علمی خیال انگیز از « دانیل کیز » ، نویسنده ی « آمریکایی » ، که با گزارشهای روزانه « چارلی گوردون » بازگو میشوند؛ « چارلی » بهره هوشی پائینی دارد، و دچار فراموشی است، او توسط دو روانپزشک، زیر عمل جراحی ارتقاء هوش قرار میگیرد، و به بهره هوشی بسیار بالایی دست مییابد؛ کتاب به بیش از پنجاه زبان رایج دنیا برگردان شده، و به صورت نمایشنامه، فیلم سینمایی، و سریال، بارها به نمایش درآمده است؛ بخش نخست از برگردان جناب آقای « بازیاری » از این کتاب به سالهای جوانی نویسنده اشاره دارد؛ دورانی که با فشار والدین، و بر خلاف علاقه ی خود، در رشته پزشکی درس میخوانده، دورانی که همزمان، نویسنده نیز بوده است؛ همین دوران موجب آفرینش داستانی شده، که بیشتر صحنه های آنرا از زندگی واقعی، و مشاهدات خود برگزیده، و ماهرانه، و طبیعی کنار هم چیده، و کتابی عرضه داشته، که بیگمان، یکی از داستانهای همه جانبه، و فراموش نشدنی، برای هر خوانشگری خواهد بودنقل از متن همین کتاب گذارش پیشرفط 1 – 5 مارس 1965میلادی؛ « دکتر « استراوس » می‌گه از امروز به بعد، من باید هر‌ چی فکر می‌کنم و هر‌ چی برام اطفاق می‌افته رو بنویسم؛ من نمی‌دونم چرا ولی اون می‌گه که این برای اینکه اون‌ها بفهمند که می‌تونند من رو استفاده کنند یا نه مهمه؛ من امیدوارم که اون‌ها من رو استفاده کنند؛ خانم « کینیان » می‌گه که شاید اون‌ها بتونند من رو باهوش کنند؛ من دوست دارم باهوش بشم؛ اسم من « چارلی گوردنه » ؛ سی و هفت سالمه، و دو هفته ‌ی پیش تولدم بود؛ من الان هیچ چیز دیگه ‌ای ندارم که بنویسم پس همین‌جا نوشتنم رو تموم می‌کنم گذارش پیشرفط 2 – 6 مارس من امروز یه تست داشتم؛ فکر می‌کنم توش افتادم؛ و برای همین هم فکر کنم اون‌ها دیگه من رو استفاده نکنند؛ چیزی که اطفاق افتاد این بود که یه مرد جوون دوست ‌داشتنی توی اتاق بود، و یه سری کارت‌های سفید، که لکه‌ های جوهر روش ریخته بود داشت؛ اون گفت « چارلی » روی این کارت چی می‌بینی؛ من با‌ وجود اینکه پای خرگوشم توی جیبم بود، خیلی ترسیده بودم، چون وقتی بچه بودم همیشه توی تست‌های مدرسه می‌افتادم، و جوهر روی کتاب‌هام پخش می‌کردممن گفتم که لکه ‌ی جوهر دیدم؛ اون گفت بله، و این باعس شد، اهساس خوبی بکنم؛ فکر کردم که همش همین بوده، ولی همین‌که پا شدم بیام بیرون، اون جلوم رو گرفت؛ اون گفت بشین « چارلی » کار ما هنوز تموم نشده؛ بعدش رو من خیلی خوب یادم نمی‌آد، ولی اون از من می‌خاست بگم توی جوهرها چی هست؛ من هیچی توی جوهرها نمی‌دیدم، ولی اون گفت که توی اون‌ها تسویر هستش، و آدم‌های دیگه یه سری تسویر دیدند؛ من نتونستم هیچ تسویری ببینم؛ من خیلی تلاش کردم که ببینم؛ من کارت رو جلوی چشمم گرفتم بعد اَقب گرفتم؛ بعدش گفتم اگه اِینکم رو داشتم بهتر می‌تونستم ببینم؛ من معمولن اِینکم رو توی سینما، یا برای دیدن تلویزون می‌زنم، با این هال گفتم که اِینکم توی کمد توی هاله؛ اِینکم رو زدم و بعد گفتم بزار اون کارت رو دوباره ببینم، شرت می‌بندم این دفعه پیداش می‌کنم؛من خیلی تلاش کردم، ولی بازهم نتونستم، اَکس‌ها رو پیدا کنم، فقط لکه‌ های جوهر رو دیدم؛ من بهش گفتم شاید اِینک جدید نیاز دارم؛ اون یه چیزی روی کاقز نوشت، و من ترسیدم که دوباره یه تست رو افتاده باشم؛ بهش گفتم که اون یه لکه ‌ی جوهر خیلی خوشگل بود، با یه ‌سری نقته ‌ی ریز دور و برش؛ ولی اون به نزر ناراهت می‌رسید، پس باید جوابم غلت بوده باشه؛ بهش گفتم بزار دوباره امتهان کنم؛ من خیلی زود پیداش می‌کنم، چون بعزی وقت‌ها خیلی سریع نیستم؛ من توی کلاس خانم « کینیان » برای بزرگسالان کندزهن هم، یه کند‌خان هستم ولی من خیلی تلاش می‌کنم؛اون با یه کارت دیگه که دوتا لکه ‌ی جوهر، یکی قرمز و یکی آبی، روش بود، یه شانس دیگه بهم داد؛اون خیلی مرد خوبی بود، و مسل خانم « کینیان » آروم حرف می‌زد، و به من توزیح داد، که این یه تجسم اهساسیه؛ اون گفت آدم‌ها توی جوهرها چیز می‌بینند؛ من گفتم نشونم بده کجا؛ گفت تسور کن؛ گفتم من یه لکه‌ ی جوهر تسور می‌کنم، ولی این هم جواب درست نبود؛ اون گفت این تو رو یاد چی می‌اندازه – یه چیزی تخیل کن؛ من چشم‌هام رو برای یه مدت تولانی بستم، تا تخیل کنم؛ گفتم یه خودکار فنری رو که جوهرش به رو‌میزی پس داده تخیل می‌کنم؛ بعد پا شدم و بیرون اومدم؛ فکر نمی‌کنم که تست تجسم اهساسی رو پاس کرده باشم؛ گذارش پیشرفط 3 – 7 مارس دکتر « استراوس » و دکتر « نمور » گفتند که نگران لکه ‌های جوهر نباشم؛ من بهشون گفتم که من جوهرها رو روی کارت‌ها نریختم، و این که من نتونستم چیزی توی جوهرها ببینم اون‌ها گفتند که شاید هنوز من رو استفاده کنند؛ من گفتم که خانم « کینیان » هیچ‌ وقت تست اون ‌توری به من نداده، فقت املا و روخانی از من تست گرفته؛ اون‌ها گفتند که خانم « کینیان » گفته که من بهترین دانش‌آموز اون توی مدرسه ‌ی شبانه ‌ی بزرگسالان هستم، چون من از همه بیشتر تلاش می‌کنم، و واقعن دوست دارم که یاد بگیرم؛ اون‌ها پرسیدند « چارلی » چی شد که تو خودت به تنهایی به مدرسه‌ ی شبانه ‌ی بزرگسالان رفتی؛ چه‌توری اون رو پیدا کردی؛ گفتم از مردم پرسیدم و یه نفر بهم گفت کجا باید برم، تا یاد بگیرم خوب بخونم و بنویسم؛ اون‌ها پرسیدند چرا می‌خای خوب بخونی و بنویسی گفتم چون تموم زندگیم دلم می‌خاست باهوش باشم و اهمق نباشم؛ ولی این خیلی سخته که باهوش باشی؛ اون‌ها بهم گفتند می‌دونی که ممکنه موقتی باشه؛ گفتم آره؛ خانم « کینیان » بهم گفت من اهمیت نمی‌دم که سدمه ببینمبعدش امروز بازهم یه تست اجیب ‌قریب داشتم؛ خانم خوبی که اون تست رو از من گرفت، اسمش رو به من گفت و من ازش خاستم که املاش رو بهم بگه تا بتونم اون رو توی گذارش پیشرفطم بنویسم؛ تست درک احساس موضوعی؛ من نمی‌دونم سه تا کلمه ‌ی آخر چه معنی می‌ده ولی می‌دونم تست یعنی چی؛ آدم باید پاسش کنه وگرنه نمره‌ ی بد می‌گیره؛ این تست به نزر آسون می‌اومد، چون من می‌تونستم اکس‌ها رو ببینم؛ ولی این دفعه اون از من نمی‌خاست که اکس‌ها رو براش بگم؛ این من رو گیج کرد؛ من بهش گفتم اون آقای دیروزی گفت من باید بهش بگم توی جوهرها چی میبینم؛ اون گفت این هیچ تفاوتی ایجاد نمی‌کنه؛ اون از من خاست تا در مورد آدم‌های توی اکس‌ها داستان سرهم کنممن ازش پرسیدم آخه آدم چه‌تور می‌تونه در مورد آدم‌هایی که تا حالا ندیده داستان تریف کنه؛ چرا من باید دروق بسازم؛ من دیگه هیچ وقت دروق نمی‌گم چون همیشه دستم رو می‌شهاون به من گفت که این تست و اون تست دیگه –تجسم اهساسی– برای خسوسی شدنه؛ من به شدت خندیدم؛ گفتم آدم چه‌تور می‌تونه با لکه‌ ی جوهر و اکس خسوسی بشه؛ اون عسبانی شد و اکس‌هاش رو کنار گزاشت؛ به من چه؛ این کار اهمقانه ‌ای بود؛ فکر کنم اون تست رو هم افتادمچند وقت بعد یه سری مرد، با روپوش‌های سفید من رو به یه قسمت دیگه ‌ی بیمارستان بردند، و بهم یه بازی دادند، تا بازی کنم؛ مسل یه مسابقه با یه موش سفید بود؛ اون‌ها موش رو « الجرنون » سدا می‌کردند؛ « الجرنون » توی یه جعبه، با یه آلمه دیوارهای پرپیچ و تاب بود، و اون‌ها به من یه مداد و یه کاقز پر از مستطیل و خط دادند؛ یه ترفش نوشته بود آغاز، و ترف دیگه ‌اش نوشته بود پایان؛ اون‌ها گفتند که این هزارتاست و من و « الجرنون » هزارتای مشابهی رو باید انجام بدیم؛ من نفهمیدم چه‌تور ممکنه ما هزارتای مشابهی داشته باشیم، در هالیکه « الجرنون » یه جعبه داشت ومن یه کاقز ولی چیزی نگفتم؛ به هرهال وقتی هم نبود که چیزی بگم چون مسابقه شروع شدیکی از مردها یه ساعت داشت که سعی می‌کرد قایمش کنه تا من نبینمش پس من سعی کردم بهش نگاه نکنم و این من رو عسبی کردبه هرهال اون تست باعس شد که من از همیشه اهساس بدتری بکنم، چون اون‌ها بیشتر از ده بار، با هزارتاهای متفاوت، تکرارش کردند، و « الجرنون » همه‌ ی دفعات رو برد؛ من نمی‌دونستم که موش‌ها این‌قدر باهوشند؛ شاید این به این خاتره که « الجرنون » یه موش سفیده؛ شاید موش‌های سفید از بقیه ‌ی موش‌ها باهوش‌ترند، و؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28091399هجری خورشیدی؛ 23061400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا شربیانی

αντίθετες κοινωνίες βλέποντας τους κανόνες και τα πιστεύω με τα οποία ζουν και σε ένα σύστημα παιχνιδιών τύχης επιδεξιότητας και πανουργίας που μας ταξιδεύει μέσα από τον γαλαξία σε μια ιδιαίτερη και μοναδική περιπέτειααπό την δημιουργία της χιλιάδες χρόνια πριν η κοινωνία του culture έχει ζήσει κάτω από τα δικά της ουτοπικά πιστεύω· μια κοινωνία η οποία χωρίς την ανάγκη μιας οικονομίας φτιάχνοντας τα πάντα εν αφθονία από άλλες πηγές έχει οδηγήσει τους ανθρώπους της να αναζητήσουν άλλους τρόπους για να περάσουν την καθημερινότητά τους εφευρίσκοντας ένα σύστημα παιχνιδιών και για τον jernau gurgeh έναν από τους κορυφαίους παίχτες στον τροχιακό chiark η μεγάλη επιδεξιότητά του τον έχει κάνει έναν από τους πιο τρομερούς και θαυμαστούς αντιπάλουςβυθισμένος όμως στην επιτυχία και την βαρεμάρα ο gurgeh θέλοντας να θυμηθεί ξανά τον ενθουσιασμό και τον φόβο της πρόκλησης που έκαναν αυτά τα παιχνίδια σπουδαία θα αρχίσει να αναζητά για νέους τρόπους για να επαναφέρει τις μακρά ξεχασμένες πρώτες αισθήσεις του δεχόμενος από άλλους να κάνει πράγματα που αλλιώς δεν θα είχε ποτέ καν λάβει υπ ’ όψινωστόσο πέφτοντας μέσα σε έναν ανεκδιήγητο εκβιασμό απειλώντας να ντροπιάσει την ευρέως διαδομένη φήμη του όταν λάβει μια πρόσκληση να συμμετάσχει σε ένα νέο παιχνίδι στην αυτοκρατορία του azad ο gurgeh θα αναγκαστεί να αποδεχτεί την ευκαιρία και να ταξιδέψει εκεί· ένα ταξίδι μακριά σε ένα ανεξερεύνητο μέρος του γαλαξία που θα τον βάλει βαθιά μέσα σε μια βάρβαρη κοινωνία και σε ένα διεφθαρμένο σύστημα παιχνιδιού γεμάτο με ίντριγκες και δολοπλοκίες που θα κάνει την μεγάλη πείρα του ασήμαντη και αν δεν καταφέρει να προσαρμοστεί στους κανόνες του μπορεί κάλλιστα να τον οδηγήσει σε κινδύνους που δεν επιδίωξε αλλά και να του κοστίσει ακόμη και την ίδια του την ζωήστο δεύτερο μυθιστόρημα του σύμπαντος του culture σε αντίθεση με την μεγαλειώδη διαστημική όπερα του consider phlebas ο iain bank παίρνει την ευκαιρία της επιτυχίας του προηγούμενου βιβλίου για να φέρει μια διαφορετική αλλά αρκετά ιδιαίτερη ιστορία· μια ιστορία που επικεντρώνεται μονάχα σε δύο κοινωνίες του culture χτισμένη για χιλιάδες χρόνια πάνω στην ισότητα της συνύπαρξης μεταξύ των ανθρώπων και αισθανόμενων μηχανών της και της αυτοκρατορίας του azad δημιουργημένη στην ανισότητα των σκληρών και βάρβαρων κανόνων της δύο κοινωνίες τελείως αντίθετες η μία με την άλληκαι σε αυτή την ιστορία ο bank μας βυθίζει μέσα στις δύο κοινωνίες του culture και του azad δημιουργώντας ένα σύστημα παιχνιδιών που μέσα από την τύχη ή την πανουργία των παιχτών τους μπορεί να κρίνει όχι μόνο την επιτυχία μέσα από τις ζωές των χαρακτήρων αλλά και να καθορίσει τα πολιτικά και θρησκευτικά πιστεύω· ένα σύστημα παιχνιδιών που στα χέρια ιδιοτελών ατόμων μπορεί να φτάσει τόσο σε τρομαχτικό όσο και σε καταστροφικό επίπεδοαλλά πέρα από την τεράστια επίπτωση αυτών των παιχνιδιών ο bank καταφέρνει να περάσει ακόμη και πολλά μηνύματα ξαναθυμίζοντας το στυλ των παλιών κλασικών συγγραφέων της επιστημονικής φαντασίας χρησιμοποιώντας τις ιδέες του με ένα έξυπνο τρόπο καθώς δημιουργεί φυλές και κόσμους που δεν έχουμε ξαναδεί και παραδίδοντας στο τέλος μέσα από μια καλύτερα χειριζόμενη γραφή μια δυνατή και βαθιά στο νόημά της περιπέτειασυνολικά το player game είναι μια καλή συνέχεια στο σύμπαν του culture με τον iain bank να μας βυθίζει μέσα σε δύο αντίθετες κοινωνίες αποκαλύπτοντας τα πιστεύω που τις αποτελούν αλλά και σε μια βαθιά ιστορία με πολλά νοήματα που δείχνει το μεγάλο του ταλέντο όπως επίσης και σε μια ιδιαίτερη περιπέτεια που δεν αποτυγχάνει να περάσει το μήνυμά της και

مکس بروکس؛ مترجم حسین شهرابی؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس، ‏‫1393؛ در 432 ص؛ شابک 9786001821219؛ چاپ دوم 1395؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی سده 21م‬جنگ جهانی ز زد عنوان یک رمان وحشت آخرالزمانی و زامبی است، که توسط نویسنده آمریکایی « مکس بروکس » نوشته شده است؛ دهسال است که بشر بر زامبیها پیروز شده، و سرانجام توانسته صلح را، به دنیا برگرداند؛ نماینده ی سازمان ملل، مشغول تهیه گزارشی است از علت شیوع بیماری زامبیها، چرایی شکست دولتهای دنیا از آن، و در نهایت چگونگی پیروزی انسان؛ در این سفر نخست به « چین » میرود، که « بیمار صفر » در آن پیدا شد، و بعد هم کم کم به همه ی دنیا از « کره شمالی » گرفته، که مردمانش غیب شده اند، تا « روسیه » ، که اکنون به امپراتوری مقدس روسیه، مبدل شده، از « کوبا » که به ابرقدرتی سرمایه دار تبدیل شده، تا « امریکا » که به سوسیالیسم روی آورده است؛ در این کتاب داستان مادرانی را خواهید خواند، که فرزندانشان را از ترس زامبیها میکشند، و نیز داستان فضانوردانی که از مدار زمین، یورش زامبیها را زیر نظر دارند؛نقل از متن هشدارها « چونگ چینگ » بزرگ، « فدراسیون متحد چین » این ناحیه، در اوجِ شکوهِ پیشاجنگش، جمعیتی بالغ بر سی و پنج میلیون نفر را، در خود جا داده بود؛ امروز بعید است به پنجاه هزار نفر هم برسند؛ سرمایه های بازسازی، هنوز پایشان به این بخش از کشور باز نشده، و دولت ترجیح داده، بر سواحل تمرکز کند، که تراکمِ جمعیتیشان بالاتر است؛ هیچ شبکه ی نیروگاهی، و برق رسانی در کار نیست، و بجز رودخانه ی « یانگ تسه » هم هیچ آبی جاری نیست؛ اما در خیابانها زباله و خاک و خاشاک به چشم نمیخورَد، و « شورای امنیتیِ » محلی هم اجازه ی وقوعِ هیچ شیوعی را پس از جنگ نداده است؛ رئیس شورا « کوانگ جینگ شو » نام دارد؛ پزشک عمومی است، و به رغم سنِ بالا، و جراحتهای جنگیش، هنوز به تک تک بیمارانش سر میزند؛اولین ظهوری که از بیماری دیدم در دهکده ای دورافتاده بود، که رسماً هیچ اسمی نداشت؛ ساکنانش میگفتند « داچانگِ نو » ، اما این اسم فقط به خاطرِ نوستالژی بود، تا هر چیز دیگری؛ خانه های پیشینشان در « داچانگ قدیم » ، از روزگارِ « سه امپراتوری » ، سرپا باقی مانده بود، و میگفتند مزارع و خانه ها، و حتا درختهایش سده ها عمر دارند؛ وقتی سدّ « سه دره » تکمیل شد، و آب مخازن سد، کم کم بالا آمد، بخش اعظم « داچانگ » را، آجر به آجر، برداشتند و دوباره در زمین بالاتری ساختند؛ اما این « داچانگ نو » دیگر شهر نبود، و به « موزه ی تاریخ ملی » مبدل شده بود؛ حتماً طعن و طنزِ تلخی برای آن زارعهای بینوا بوده، که دیدند شهرشان نجات پیدا کرده، اما الان دیگر مجبورند بلیت بخرند، تا از آن دیدن کنند؛ شاید به همین دلیل بود که بعضی از آنها ترجیح دادند اسمِ آبادیِ تازه سازشان را « داچانگ نو » بگذارند، بلکه پیوندی با میراث کهنشان برقرار بماند؛ حتا اگر فقط به اسم باشد؛ من اصلاً خبر نداشتم که جایی به اسم « داچانگ نو » وجود دارد؛ پس امیدوارم بفهمید که چرا وقتی به من تلفن زدند، و صحبتِ آنجا را کردند، چقدر تعجب کردم؛در بیمارستان خبری نبود؛ حتا به رغمِ افزایشِ آمارِ تصادفهای ناشی از مستی، شب بی سروصدایی بود؛ استفاده از موتورسیکلت کم کم رایج میشد؛ بین خودمان زیاد میگفتیم که آن « هارلی دِیویدسون » های شما بیشتر چینی به کشتن داد، تا کلِ سربازهای امریکایی توی جنگ « کره » ؛ به همین خاطر قدردانِ آن شیفت خلوت بودم؛ خسته بودم و کمر و پاهایم درد میکردند؛ میخواستم بروم بیرون سیگار بکشم، و طلوع را تماشا کنم، که شنیدم اسمم را

نگار، سال1390؛ در190ص؛ شابک9786009174816؛ جاده، روایتی از آخرالزمان است؛ شرح سفر پدر و پسری، در جهان ویران پس از یک انفجار اتمی ا­ست؛ با اینکه سال­ها از انفجار اتمی بگذشته، اما هیچ نشانه ­ای، از شکل­گیری دوباره ­ی حیات، بر روی زمین، به ­چشم نمی­آید؛ پدر و پسر، در طول سفر، با آدم­ها که روبرو می­شوند، از آن­ها می­گریزند، یا آنها را می­کشند؛ جز سفر، خوانشگر در رمان، با هیچ طرح روایی دیگر، مواجه نیست؛ تنها یک زمان و مکان وجود دارد؛ قلمرو روایت، مثل هاله ی سبزرنگ دوربین­های خبری، در اطراف پدر و پسر است؛ و از آن فراتر نمی­رود؛ روایت، سرگرم ارائه ی گزارش جزیی و دقیق، از رفتار آن دو است؛ چشم انداز طبیعت « تهی » ، « ویران » و خرابه؛ با گزاره ­های قطعی، و ساده، اما با حوصله، گزارش می­شود؛ هیچ چیزی، شبیه چیز دیگر نیست، زیرا احتمالاً آن دومی، دیگر وجود ندارد؛ با آرزوی صلح، بین انسانها، تا این بهشت زمین نیز، هرگزی انسان را، به بیرون از خویش، پرتاب نکند؛نقل از متن از میان گل و لای گذشتند، و به جاده برگشتند؛ بوی خاک و خاکستر نمناک، توی باران شناور بود؛ آب سیاه، توی گودال کنار جاده، جریان داشت؛ آبی که از درون آب گذری فلزی، به داخل یک گودال، مکیده‌ می‌شود؛ گوزنی پلاستیکی، وسط یک حیاط افتاده بود؛ اواخر روز بعد، وارد شهر کوچکی شدند؛ سه مرد از پشت کامیونی بیرون آمدند، و توی جاده، مقابل‌شان ایستادند؛ مردانی لاغر، که لباس‌هایی مندرس، به تن داشتند، و لوله ‌ای در دست، از آن‌ها پرسیدند توی چرخ چی دارین؟ مرد تپانچه ‌اش را، به سوی آن‌ها گرفت؛ ایستادند؛ پسرک گوشه ‌ی کتش را چسبید؛ هیچکس حرفی نزد؛ چرخ ‌دستی را جلو انداخت، و با هم کنار جاده رفتند؛ چرخ را دست پسرک داد؛ عقب عقب می‌رفت، و تپانچه را، همچنان به سمت مردان، نگاه داشته بود؛ می‌کوشید هم‌چون قاتلی حرفه ‌ای، به نظر برسد، اما قلبش، به شدت می‌تپید، و می‌دانست، که سرفه ‌اش خواهد گرفت؛ دوباره، وسط جاده آمدند، و ایستادند، و آن‌ها را نظاره ‌کردند؛ مرد تپانچه را، توی کمرش گذاشت، و برگشت و چرخ‌دستی را گرفت؛ بالای بلندی که رسیدند، مرد برگشت و دید، که آن‌ها هنوز همانجا ایستاده ‌اند؛ از پسرک خواست، تا چرخ را هل بدهد؛ از حیاطی گذشت، و از مکانی مسلط به جاده، پایین را پایید؛ مردان رفته بودند؛ پسرک به شدت ترسیده بود؛ مرد تپانچه را روی برزنت روی چرخ گذاشت، و چرخ ‌دستی را گرفت، و به راه‌شان ادامه دادند؛ توی دشتی، روی زمین دراز کشیدند، و جاده را پاییدند، تا تاریک شد؛ اما کسی نیامد؛ هوا بسیار سرد بود؛ وقتی هوا کاملا تاریک شد، طوری که دیگر نمی‌شد جایی را دید، افتان و خیزان، به جاده برگشتند؛ مرد پتوها را بیرون آورد؛ خودشان را خوب پیچیدند، و دوباره، به راه افتادند؛ آسفالت را زیر پای‌شان دنبال می‌کردند؛ یکی از چرخ‌های چرخ ‌دستی، هر چند وقت یک‌بار، به جیرجیر می‌افتاد؛ اما کاری نمی‌شد کرد؛ باز هم پیش رفتند؛ وقتی رعد و برق دیگری، ساحل را، روشن کرد، پسرک را دید، که خم شده بود، و با خودش زمزمه می‌کرد؛ کوشید، رد پاهایشان را دوباره ببیند، اما نتوانست؛ سرعت باد بیش‌تر شده بود؛ مرد منتظر اولین قطره‌ های باران بود؛ اگر توی ساحل، وسط باد و باران، گرفتار می‌شدند، حسابی به زحمت می‌افتادند؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28111399هجری
